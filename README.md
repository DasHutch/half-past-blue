# Half-Past-Blue

Implementation of 'Color Clock' in Swift 2.0
Goal of this is to just build a simple universal app (iPhone, iPad) including mutlitasking for iPad
and maybe a Apple Watch app as well. Instead of using Hexadecimal colors from time, I'll be using HSB.
Looking at using the Hours to cycle through the Hue, Minutes to Adjust Brightness, and Seconds to cycle through Saturation...

Digital Clock Face and Analog Clock Face, with simple interaction reveal the color information for a given time.

## TODO:
- Analog Clock Face
- Double Tap to change clock face
- Single Tap 'bounce' or something like an Alert to educate on swapping digital / analog
- UI for displaying Color info at a given time
- ColorManager Class for handling color choices from a NSDate
- ~~Use MonoSpace font~~
- Use Custom MonoSpace Font
- ~~Hide Status Bar~~
- ~~Create Clock Model (refactor)~~
- Write UI Tests
- Write Unit Tests
